					<h1>About <span>Velvet</span></h1>
					<p>In a society in which people are expected to work long hours and pass on vacation days, there is an underlying belief that we must always be productive – which can ultimately take away from opportunities for self-care.Perhaps the single most common reason people give for not participating in self-care is due to a lack of time.And thats why we are here to help you.According to your needs we can help you to make your personalized self care plan. Our specialist can also help you to choose your activities.<br>
					Remember that self-care is all about you. What works for one person may not work for another, but that’s the beauty of a self-care routine. Perhaps some suggestions you have heard in the past did not work. Please do not be discouraged. You are encouraged to continue searching until you find the best fit. The catch, though, is that it must be done both intentionally and consistently to have maximum impact. Even if you only have 5-minute increments spread throughout the day to engage in self-care, that is certainly better than nothing. Over time, you may significantly enhance your overall health and wellbeing. Even if you are just beginning, there are results that may be realized almost immediately.</p>

					<h1>What is exactly is self-care?</h1>
					<p class="cat">There is no single definition of self-care, but it is often described as performing a series of actions to improve your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. Practicing self-care means working to eliminate as many triggers of stress as possible. This does not mean that you are prioritizing yourself over anything or anyone else – it simply means you are relaxing and recovering in order to perform at the best of your ability when needed. It is very self-defeating, if not impossible, to try to care only for others at the expense of yourself. Self-care comes in many different forms, from taking a small stretch break at work to practicing guided meditation at home.<br>
					Practicing self-care promotes a healthy relationship with yourself to the benefit of your physical, mental, and emotional health. When you are unable to care for yourself, it is nearly impossible to care for others. Therefore, self-care allows you to establish a positive mindset that will translate to good feelings and emotions for others around you. By making the time to let yourself recharge, you will improve the outlook of yourself and others as well as develop significantly lower unhealthy amounts of stress.</p>

					<p>Self-care should not be viewed as something you only do if you have time. Neither is self-care something that should only be a reward that can be gained once other tasks are completed.<br>

Self-care, if practiced appropriately, needs to be an integral part of your daily life. Fortifying your emotional, physical, and spiritual health through self-care is the foundation for your overall health and well-being.<br>
And our purpose is to make people aware of this.</p>
